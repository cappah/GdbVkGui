# GdbVkGui
GDB Frontend using X, Vulkan, and ImGui

Wanted an easily configurable frontend for gdb for the few things I use it for. TUI interface for gdb just doesn't cut it. Also, I use this project to play around w/ low-level C programming. 

Making it public for others in case you'd like to use it to. There's a .deb to download it on the releases page if you don't want to download it and vuild from source. I'll update this when I have the free time.
